For this review of CSS Grid and Flex-box, we will start to mimic the sight "CSS Zen Garden."

The homepage of this site will be a great time to practice CSS Grid and the icons at the bottom will help us see how flex-box is used with CSS Grid. 

This website uses the same HTML to render totally different experiences using different CSS only. Those links can be found in the panel to the right. (This will be our <div/> #4)

The HTML and CSS in this scrimba cast is a good springboard to copying the layout. I've added some boarder and background color to highlight points of interest. 

1. Go to csszengarden.com and become familiar with it in a large window and compare it to it when it's a small window.  

2. Copy and paste the HTML and CSS from this Scrimba Cast into a new directory in your exercises folder. Youâ€™ll want to take advantage of the developer tools in Chrome.  

3. Follow the directions in the comments of style.css to apply the same functionality as CSS Zen Garden has. If you get stuck, there is help!
